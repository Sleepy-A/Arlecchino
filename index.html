            <h2 class="heading">Story Quest Of <span>Arlecchino</span></h2>
            <h3>The Child who doesnt exist</h3>
            <p>While continuing their travels around Fontaine, 
                Paimon suggests going to Poisson. When they arrive, they're greeted by Lyney, 
                who is surprised to see them. Paimon wonders if he came to host a show, though Lyney reveals that due to some trouble on the front, "Father" arranged for Lyney and the others to stay in Poisson. 
                Arlecchino surprises Paimon, and while she states that it would be normal for them to be wary of the Fatui, 
                she has no qualms with them right now. She also reveals that the matter at hand is a rumor spreading around the House of the Hearth that a "phantom child" is among them, 
                something that should have not surfaced at all. Thus, she moved everyone to Poisson so she could weed out the suspect.
                 As she leaves to handle some matters, she tasks Lyney with entertaining them while they're staying in town.
            </p>

            <h3>Sea Breeze Rendezvous</h3>
            <p>The Traveler and Paimon look for Arlecchino, finding her with Childe at Poisson's shore. 
                Childe had returned to Fontaine after realizing he was going back to Snezhnaya, 
                as he wanted to speak with Skirk and asked Arlecchino if she could help locate her. 
                They were unsuccessful in doing so. Arlecchino then mentions "Project Stuzha" with Regrator, 
                which Childe is not eager to participate in. As she prepares to make her leave, Paimon stops her, 
                and the Traveler asks her about what the House meant to her. Before she could explain, 
                Childe states that he enjoyed spending time with the children, but would go after her if she harmed them. 
                He had also heard a rumor from the Rooster that she had betrayed the House and attacked her own "family". 
                Arlecchino appears to be relatively calm at the accusation, stating that he was not lying, 
                but she states that there was a certain level of prejudice involved. She reveals that she herself is not an actual Fontanian, 
                though she misled others into believing so for convivence.
            </p>

            <h3>Birds in a Cage</h3>
            <p>As Lyney and the others prepare, the Traveler asks him if Arlecchino and Dottore had worked together. 
                Lyney tells them that when Arlecchino became a Harbinger, 
                Dottore had proposed to work together, though she quickly rejected all but one. 
                They are not sure if it was related to Project Stuzha, though they carry out the plan as normal. 
                When they return to Arlecchino, she reveals that she had known of their ruse from the beginning, 
                and tells them to meet up with her at Palais Mermonia if they valued their friends' lives. 
                Before leaving, they release the pigeon Lyney gave them.
            </p>

            <h3>Into the Sunlight</h3>
            <p>At some nameless ruins at Mont Esus East, Arlecchino reveals her past to the two. 
                The building they were at was where she killed Clervie and "Mother" before she became a Harbinger. 
                She explains that Clervie was the biological daughter of Crucabena, or "Mother", 
                who was brought into the House when she was six. She soon realized that the "family" she was with was actually a purgatory,
                 making war orphans fight each other to become "King". Those who were permanently injured were either given to Dottore or sent on dangerous missions. 
                 Clervie tried to convince Crucabena to change her ways to no avail, 
                resulting in only one other person trusting her - Peruere, or "Perrie", who also saw through Crucabena's lies.
